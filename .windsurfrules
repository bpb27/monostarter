1. This is a monorepo using TurboRepo.
2. I use pnpm.
3. I'm using Node 22.
4. I want all external packages to be on the same version.
5. When adding a new package (nowhere else in the monorepo) install the latest version.
6. Remember that new monorepo apps and packages should
  - use @repo/typescript-config
  - don't need to install typescript (it's in the root)
  - should following the workspace naming convention @repo/the-new-thing
7. Packages should use tsc for dev and build scripts whenever possible.
8. Packages should use exports in package.json rather than main or module.
9. I'm using Valibot (not Zod).

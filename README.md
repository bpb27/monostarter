## About

This is an example/starter for a Typescript monorepo with TurboRepo. Eventually it will contain a user app, admin app, Node.js server, and Storybook, deployable to AWS with GitHub actions for CI/CD.

This is a work in progress.

## Setup

1. Use Node.js 22 (recommend using [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) or [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise) for version management)
2. `npm i -g pnpm@9.15.4` (if not installed already)
3. `pnpm install`
4. `pnpm dev`

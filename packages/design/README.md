## TODO

#### Recipes
- Button, Input, Box
- More constrained theme
- Naming - maybe a-2px, b-4px, or something

#### Separate package
Try generating styled-system into a new workspace package.
It should probably just have a package.json config that points to exports (panda emit-package).
The styled-system dir should be in gitignore.
This repo can point to it.
Also exports a style.css file?
Does it have every css class? does that matter? does it scan other parts of the repo?
